For example, this week's theme could be place of worship, and next week's theme could be 'elementary school', and so on. As a reward for completing a challenge, users get points or badges. Furthermore, there can also be user ranking based on points or badges accumulation. At last, OpenStreetMap can let users share and showcase their OSM contribution on online social media, not only as a way to motivate current users but also to motivate new people to contribute to OpenStreetMap.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "It is obvious after reviewing that the OSM data of Dallas area need further cleaning. Though most of the cleaning process can be done programmatically, manual cleaning might also be needed to handle special cases. Since clean data promote data consistency, this process is worth the effort though there is always a possibility of getting a less desirable side effect that a significant chunk of data could be trashed by a strict cleaning process. Additionally, data completeness is also a problem in OSM data that can only be improved by pulling location information from electronic devices instead of relying on users to input them manually.\n",
